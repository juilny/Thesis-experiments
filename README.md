# Thesis-experiments

Here are the code used to perform experiments in thesis called "Quantum computation and quantum algorithms". The code written in Python using Qiskit API for IBM quantum computers and is in the form of Jupyter Notebook files. They will not be in the exact form as when the experiments were performed in late 2020, but rather cleaned up, commented and the code is fixed to a more linear order so they are easier to follow.

I am the author of the code, the code was written following tutorials provided by IBM Qiskit team, Nielsen's book and the articles of the original scientific articles/publications. I claim no licence over the code and would wish only to be credited in case there are direct copying from the code.

Thank you,
J. Nyk√§nen

TODO:
- Add names to articles
- Add name to books
- Add the working version of Python and Qiskit used
